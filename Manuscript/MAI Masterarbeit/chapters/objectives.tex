\chapter{Objective}\label{ch:Objective}
This thesis aims to assess drug efficacy by ranking different drug combinations and concentrations. The ranking is based on features extracted from bright-field microscopy images of  three-dimensional tumor tissue models using representation learning. The primary challenge lies in learning the efficient features of alterations induced in these tumor tissue models by the impact of drug application over a period of time.
