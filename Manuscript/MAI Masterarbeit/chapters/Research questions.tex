1. Can we learn latent features that capture the alterations 
induced in three-dimensional tumor tissue models by drug application over a period of time?

2.  Will these features can effectively establish a ranking of drug efficacy 
from bright-field microscopy images?

2. What methodologies and frameworks can be employed to extract and learn these
 hidden representations efficiently?

3. What could be reasonable metrics, such as L2 loss or cosine similarity, for 
supporting the relative assessment of drug efficacy?

4. can unsupervised learning be used to tackle this ranking problem since lack of label is 
our main challenge?

5. How do we deal with the position change in the image collection of day 10 if we want to use prediction 
model as one of our rankng startegy.

6. How do we incorporate the fact about brightness/blur change in the image collection due to environmental or microscope 
variations?

7. how do we deal with the insufficient data problem?
