1. Can we learn latent features that effectively establish a ranking of drug efficacy from bright-field microscopy images, specifically features that capture the alterations induced in three-dimensional tumor tissue models by drug application over a period of time?

2. What methodologies and frameworks can be employed to extract and learn these hidden representations efficiently?

3. What could be reasonable metrics, such as L2 loss or cosine similarity, for supporting the relative assessment of drug efficacy?
